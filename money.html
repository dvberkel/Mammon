	  <h2>History of Money</h2>
	  <p>
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics" alt="Wikipedia on Numismatics">Numismatics</a>
	    studies money and its history. The following exposition is
	    largerly taken from the Wikipedia entry about
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money" alt="Wikipedia on 'History of Money'">History of Money</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Before the introduction of money there were three possible
	    means of exchanging goods. They are
	    <ul>
	      <li>Barter</li>
	      <li>Gift</li>
	      <li>Debt</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="span4">
	  <h3>Barter</h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>
	      The action or system of exchanging goods or services
	      without using money. 
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    With barter, an individual possessing a material object of
	    value, such as a measure of grain, could directly exchange
	    that object for another object perceived to have
	    equivalent value, such as a small animal, a clay pot or a
	    tool. The capacity to carry out transactions is severely
	    limited since it depends on a coincidence of wants. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <h3>Gift</h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>
	      Give (something) as a gift, esp. formally or as a donation
	      or bequest. 
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    In a gift economy, valuable goods and services are
	    regularly given without any explicit agreement for
	    immediate or future rewards (i.e. there is no formal quid
	    pro quo). Ideally, simultaneous or recurring giving
	    serves to circulate and redistribute valuables within the
	    community. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <h3>Debt</h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>
	      Something that is owed or due.
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    There are various social theories concerning gift
	    economies. One interpretation is that implicit "I owe you"
	    debt and social status are awarded in return for the
	    'gifts'. Consider for example, the sharing of food in some
	    hunter-gatherer societies, where food-sharing is a
	    safeguard against the failure of any individual's daily
	    foraging.

	  <h2>Problems with 'Gift Economies'</h2>
	  <p>
	    David Graeber's research indicates 'gift economies' were
	    common, at least the beginnings of the first agrarian
	    societies, when humans used elaborate credit systems based
	    on gift economy to buy and sell goods prior to the
	    invention of formal money. Since invading soldiers are not
	    generally local, known and trustworthy people, money may
	    have been invented as an alternative to economic tool to
	    discourage or deter armed robbery and looting. 
	  </p>
	  <h2>Coinage</h2>
	  <p>
	    It has long been assumed that from early times, metals,
	    where available, have usually been favored for use as
	    proto-money over such commodities as cattle, cowry shells,
	    or salt, because they are at once durable, portable, and
	    easily divisible.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The use of gold as proto-money has been
	    traced back to the fourth millennium BC when the Egyptians
	    used gold bars of a set weight as a medium of exchange as
	    had been done earlier in Mesopotamia with silver bars. The
	    first known ruler who officially set standards of weight
	    and money was Pheidon. From approximately 1000 BC China
	    used money in the shape of small knives and spades made of
	    bronze, and had used cast bronze replica of cowrie shells
	    even before that. In the early first millenia BC precious
	    metals in ingot form had been used in international
	    commerce, but not in common transactions. The first
	    manufactured coins seems to have taken place separately in
	    India, China, and in cities around the Agean sea between
	    700 and 500 BC.
