	  <h2>History of Money</h2>
	  <p>
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics" alt="Wikipedia on Numismatics">Numismatics</a>
	    studies money and its history. The following exposition is
	    largerly taken from the Wikipedia entry about
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money" alt="Wikipedia on 'History of Money'">History of Money</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Before the introduction of money there were three possible
	    means of exchanging goods. They are
	    <ul>
	      <li>Barter</li>
	      <li>Gift</li>
	      <li>Debt</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="span4">
	  <h3>Barter</h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>
	      The action or system of exchanging goods or services
	      without using money. 
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    With barter, an individual possessing a material object of
	    value, such as a measure of grain, could directly exchange
	    that object for another object perceived to have
	    equivalent value, such as a small animal, a clay pot or a
	    tool. The capacity to carry out transactions is severely
	    limited since it depends on a coincidence of wants. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <h3>Gift</h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>
	      Give (something) as a gift, esp. formally or as a donation
	      or bequest. 
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    In a gift economy, valuable goods and services are
	    regularly given without any explicit agreement for
	    immediate or future rewards (i.e. there is no formal quid
	    pro quo). Ideally, simultaneous or recurring giving
	    serves to circulate and redistribute valuables within the
	    community. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
	  <h3>Debt</h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>
	      Something that is owed or due.
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    There are various social theories concerning gift
	    economies. One interpretation is that implicit "I owe you"
	    debt and social status are awarded in return for the
	    'gifts'. Consider for example, the sharing of food in some
	    hunter-gatherer societies, where food-sharing is a
	    safeguard against the failure of any individual's daily
	    foraging.
