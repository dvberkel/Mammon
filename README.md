Mammon
======

Mammon is a distributed IOU management system, capable of running in daemon mode on a server and also able to run on a mobile phone. A peer-to-peer network between servers allows (circular) debts to be resolved, while the mobile application allows users to issue and transfer IOUs without requiring an active internet connection.
