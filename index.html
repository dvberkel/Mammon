	  <p>
	    Mammon is a distributed IOU management system, capable of
	    running in daemon mode on a server and also able to run on
	    a mobile phone. A peer-to-peer network between servers
	    allows (circular) debts to be resolved, while the mobile
	    application allows users to issue and transfer IOUs
	    without requiring an active internet connection.

	  <h2>What's In A Name</h2>
	  <p>
	    Etymologically, the word <em>Mammon</em> assumed to derive
	    from Late Latin 'mammon', from Greek '&mu;&alpha;&mu;&mu;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;', Syriac
	    'm&aacute;m&oacute;na' meaning riches and was an Aramaic loan word in
	    Hebrew meaning wealth or possessions, although it
	    may also have meant 'that in which one trusts'.

	  <h2>History of Money</h2>
	  <p>
	    Money has changed it's guise many times over the course of
	    its history. <em>Mammon</em> is just an other manifestation.
